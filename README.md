# PlaneDisplay

The goal of this project is to read the matrix rotation of a vehicle in a video game. Once we have those angles, I transfer this data to an Arduino UNO that drives stepper motors. Those stepper motors will display the currents angles of the vehicle.

Reading the matrix rotation is easy. I read the memory - using the ReadProcessMemory() function - of GTA San Andreas in order to obtain it. Look at main.cpp in the GTASA folder to read the code. GTA San Andreas Memory addresses are quite well known and well documented.

In order to drive the stepper motors, I use DRV8825 modules Those modules are quite simple. Each pulse on the STEP pin will drive the motor to one step. In order to choose the direction, I correctly drive the DIR pin.

## Repository

./GTASA/    -> Contains the code that read and compute the plane angle.
./Arduino/  -> Contains the code that runs on the Arduino. It receives order from the UART and then drive the step motor.
